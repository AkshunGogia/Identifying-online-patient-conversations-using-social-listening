# Identifying-online-patient-conversations-using-social-listening

Social Listening is used for gaining insights from social media platforms like twitter, Facebook, forums, blogs etc . Conversations are 
posted by multiple stakeholders like patients, doctors, media houses, general public, etc. Build an Intelligent pipeline that can 
segregate patient conversations from the rest of the group given historically tagged patient data. Text Mining techniques like 
corpus creation, Wordcloud generation , Trigram tokenizer, Levenshtein distances etc were used. Xgboost and GBM algorithms were used for 
prediction. An AUC score of 0.92 was achieved.
